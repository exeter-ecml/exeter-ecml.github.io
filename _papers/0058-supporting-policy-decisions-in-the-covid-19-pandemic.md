abstract: "
In a pandemic that affects every aspect of life, how do policy makers make
well-informed decisions to effectively mitigate the terrible impacts to life
and the society as a whole? The general approach is: there are existing
sophisticated and realistic compartmental models (e.g. Ferguson et al.) of how
the pandemic spreads. These models have parameters that encapsulate the nature
of the virus, and potential actions of the policy makers and private
individuals. Thus, varying these parameters we can fit the observed data, and
also query tentative policy actions based on the relevant forecasts. This
analysis is the basis of informed decision making for the best estimated
outcomes, but it remains very much a manual approach. On top of that this is
computationally expensive, and requires substantial involvement of the experts.
In this preliminary work, we investigate how we can create an interactive tool
that exposes compartmental models to experts and policy makers so that they can
rapidly investigate future scenarios based on recently observed data.
