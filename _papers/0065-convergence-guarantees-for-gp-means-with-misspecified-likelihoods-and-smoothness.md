abstract: "
Gaussian processes are ubiquitous in machine learning, statistics, and applied
mathematics. They provide a flexible modelling framework for approximating
functions, whilst simultaneously quantifying uncertainty. However, this is only
true when the model is well-specified, which is often not the case in practice.
In this paper, we study the properties of Gaussian process means when the
smoothness of the model and the likelihood function are misspecified. In this
setting, an important theoretical question of practical relevance is how
accurate the Gaussian process approximations will be given the chosen model and
the extent of the misspecification. The answer to this problem is particularly
useful since it can inform our choice of model and experimental design. In
particular, we describe how the experimental design and choice of kernel and
kernel hyperparameters can be adapted to alleviate model misspecification.
