abstract: "
The growing number of novel swarm-based meta-heuristics has been raising
debates regarding their novelty. These algorithms often claim to be inspired
by different concepts from nature but the proponents of these seldom
demonstrate whether the novelty goes beyond the nature inspiration. In this
work, we employed the concept of interaction networks to capture the
interaction patterns that take place in algorithms during the optimisation
process. The analyses of these networks reveal aspects of the algorithm such as
the tendency to achieve premature convergence, population diversity, and
stability. Furthermore, we make use of portrait divergence, a newly-proposed
state-of-the-art metric, to assess structural similarities between our
interaction networks. Using this approach to analyse the cat swarm optimization
(CSO) algorithm, we were able to identify some of the algorithm's
characteristics, assess the impact of one of the CSO's parameters, and compare
this algorithm to two other well-known methods (particle swarm optimization and
artificial bee colony). Lastly, we discuss the relationship between the
interaction network and the performance of the algorithms assessed.
