abstract: "
The application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to real-world problems comes
with inherent challenges, primarily the difficulty in defining the large number
of considerations needed when designing complex systems such as Water
Distribution Networks (WDN). One solution is to use an Interactive Evolutionary
Algorithm (IEA), which integrates a human expert into the optimisation process
and helps guide it to solutions more suited to real-world application. The
involvement of an expert provides the algorithm with valuable domain knowledge;
however, it is an intensive task requiring extensive interaction, leading to user
fatigue and reduced effectiveness. To address this, the authors have developed
methods for capturing human expertise from user interactions utilising machine
learning to produce Human-Derived Heuristics (HDH) which are integrated into an
EA's mutation operator. This work focuses on the development of an adaptive
method for applying multiple HDHs throughout an EA's search. The new adaptive
approach is shown to outperform both singular HDH approaches and traditional
EAs on a range of large scale WDN design problems. This work paves the way for
the development of a new type of IEA that has the capability of learning from
human experts whilst minimising user fatigue.
