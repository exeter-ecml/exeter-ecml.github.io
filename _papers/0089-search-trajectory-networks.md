abstract: "
A large number of metaheuristics inspired by natural and social phenomena have
been proposed in the last few decades, each trying to be more powerful and
innovative than others. However, there is a lack of accessible tools to
analyse, contrast and visualise the behaviour of metaheuristics when solving
optimisation problems. When the metaphors are stripped away, are these
algorithms different in their behaviour? To help to answer this question, we
propose a data-driven, graph-based model, *search trajectory networks* (STNs)
in order to analyse, visualise and directly contrast the behaviour of different
types of metaheuristics. One strength of our approach is that it does not
require any additional sampling or algorithmic methods. Instead, the models are
constructed from data gathered while the metaheuristics are solving the
optimisation problems. We present our methodology, and consider in detail two
case studies covering both continuous and combinatorial optimisation. In terms
of metaheuristics, our case studies cover the main current paradigms:
evolutionary, swarm, and stochastic local search approaches.
