abstract: "
Breast cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancer for women. The disease
has a good prognosis when diagnosed early. The gold standard for the diagnosis
of breast cancer is mammography imaging analysis. However, the acquisition of
mammograms involves a painful and embarrassing procedure, with breast
compression. Alternative methods have been investigated in the last years,
including breast thermographs, which do not involve ionizing radiation, pain or
contact with the breast. However, the performance of these modern techniques
still needs to be improved to allow widespread use in practical applications.
Machine learning techniques have contributed to increase accuracy and reduce
false positives and false negatives in the analysis of breast thermograms. We
propose a methodology for the detection and classification of breast lesions
using a database of real images of Brazilian patients. We divide our
methodology into three steps. In the first step, shape and texture
characteristics of breast thermograms are extracted using the moments of
Zernike and Haralick. The second step is the feature selection process using
multi-objective binary optimization algorithms based on swarm intelligence. The
third step is the analysis of the classification of the best vectors using
Convolutive Neural Networks, Extreme Learning Machines and Support Vector
Machines. Finally, we discuss the computational time and performance of various
techniques based on swarm intelligence, artificial neural networks and
statistical models to improve the time and accuracy of the breast cancer
diagnosis. We perform additional analysis of shape and texture characteristics.
We discuss the use of multi-objective fish school search algorithms to select
characteristics extracted from thermography images. From the results, we
observe the feature selection process has helped us to decrease computational
time, with a high potential to improve diagnostic accuracy.
