abstract: "
A Local Optima Network (LON) is a graph model that compresses the fitness 
landscape of a particular combinatorial optimization problem based on a 
specific neighborhood operator and a local search algorithm. Determining which
and how landscape features affect the effectiveness of search algorithms is 
relevant for both predicting their performance and improving the design 
process. This paper proposes the concept of multi-layer LONs as well as a 
methodology to explore these models aiming at extracting metrics for fitness 
landscape analysis. Constructing such models, extracting and analyzing their 
metrics are the preliminary steps into the direction of extending the study on
single neighborhood operator heuristics to more sophisticated ones that use 
multiple operators. Therefore, in the present paper we investigate a two-layer 
LON obtained from instances of a combinatorial problem using bit-flip and swap
operators. First, we enumerate instances of NK-landscape model and use the 
hill climbing heuristic to build the corresponding LONs. Then, using LON 
metrics, we analyze how efficiently the search might be when combining
both strategies. The experiments show promising results and demonstrate the ability of multi-layer LONs to provide useful information that could be used for in metaheuristics based on multiple operators such as Variable Neighborhood Search.
