abstract: "
Measuring the discrepancy between two probability distributions is a
fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics. We propose a new class
of discrepancies based on the optimal loss for a decision task -- two
distributions are different if the optimal decision loss is higher on their
mixture than on each individual distribution. By suitably choosing the
decision task, this generalizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the maximum
mean discrepancy family. We apply our approach to two-sample tests, and on
various benchmarks, we achieve superior test power compared to competing
methods. In addition, a modeler can directly specify their preferences when
comparing distributions through the decision loss. We apply this property to
understanding the effects of climate change on different social and economic
activities, evaluating sample quality, and selecting features targeting
different decision tasks.
