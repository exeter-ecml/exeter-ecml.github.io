abstract: "
With the availability of data, hardware, software ecosystem and relevant skill
sets, the machine learning community is undergoing a rapid development with
new architectures and approaches appearing at high frequency every year. In
this article, we conduct an exemplary image classification study in order to
demonstrate how confidence intervals around accuracy measurements can greatly
enhance the communication of research results as well as impact the reviewing
process. In addition, we explore the hallmarks and limitations of this
approximation. We discuss the relevance of this approach reflecting on a
spotlight publication of ICLR22. A reproducible workflow is made available as
an open-source adjoint to this publication. Based on our discussion, we make
suggestions for improving the authoring and reviewing process of machine
learning articles.
