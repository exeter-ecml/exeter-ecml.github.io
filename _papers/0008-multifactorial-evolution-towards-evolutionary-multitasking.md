abstract: "
The design of evolutionary algorithms has typically been focused on efficiently
solving a single optimization problem at a time. Despite the implicit
parallelism of population-based search, no attempt has yet been made to
multitask, i.e., to solve multiple optimization problems simultaneously using a
single population of evolving individuals. Accordingly, this paper introduces
evolutionary multitasking as a new paradigm in the field of optimization and
evolutionary computation. We first formalize the concept of evolutionary
multitasking and then propose an algorithm to handle such problems. The
methodology is inspired by biocultural models of multifactorial inheritance,
which explain the transmission of complex developmental traits to offspring
through the interactions of genetic and cultural factors. Furthermore, we
develop a cross-domain optimization platform that allows one to solve diverse
problems concurrently. The numerical experiments reveal several potential
advantages of implicit genetic transfer in a multitasking environment. Most
notably, we discover that the creation and transfer of refined genetic material
can often lead to accelerated convergence for a variety of complex optimization
functions.
