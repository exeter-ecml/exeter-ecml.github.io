abstract: "
In many areas of science and technology, mathematical models are built to 
simulate complex real world phenomena. Such models are typically implemented in
large computer programs and are also very complex, such that the way that the
model responds to changes in its inputs is not transparent. Sensitivity
analysis is concerned with understanding how changes in the model inputs
influence the outputs. This may be motivated simply by a wish to understand the
implications of a complex model but often arises because there is uncertainty
about the true values of the inputs that should be used for a particular
application. A broad range of measures have been advocated in the literature to 
quantify and describe the sensitivity of a model's output to variation in its
inputs. In practice the most commonly used measures are those that are based on
formulating uncertainty in the model inputs by a joint probability distribution
and then analysing the induced uncertainty in outputs, an approach which is
known as probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We present a Bayesian framework
which unifies the various tools of probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The
Bayesian approach is computationally highly efficient. It allows effective
sensitivity analysis to be achieved by using far smaller numbers of model runs
than standard Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, all measures of interest may be
computed from a single set of runs.
