abstract: "
How do machine-learning researchers run their empirical validation?  In the 
context of a push for improved reproducibility and benchmarking, this question
is important to develop new tools for model comparison. This document
summarizes a simple survey about experimental procedures, sent to authors of
published papers at two leading conferences, NeurIPS2019 and ICLR 2020. 
It gives a simple picture of how hyperparameters are set, how many baselines
and datasets are included, or how seeds are used.
