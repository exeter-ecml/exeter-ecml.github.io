abstract: "
Diffusion models are a class of deep generative models that have shown
impressive results on various tasks with a solid theoretical foundation.
Despite demonstrated success than state-of-the-art approaches, diffusion models
often entail costly sampling procedures and sub-optimal likelihood estimation.
Significant efforts have been made to improve the performance of diffusion
models in various aspects. In this article, we present a comprehensive review
of existing variants of diffusion models. Specifically, we provide the taxonomy
of diffusion models and categorize them into three types: sampling-acceleration
enhancement, likelihood-maximization enhancement, and data-generalization
enhancement. We also introduce the other generative models (i.e., variational
autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flow, autoregressive
models, and energy-based models) and discuss the connections between diffusion
models and these generative models. Then we review the applications of
diffusion models, including computer vision, natural language processing,
waveform signal processing, multi-modal modeling, molecular graph generation,
time series modeling, and adversarial purification. Furthermore, we propose new
perspectives pertaining to the development of generative model.
