abstract: "
In the past few years we have seen the meteoric appearance of dozens of models
of the Transformer family, all of which have funny, but not self-explanatory,
names. The goal of this paper is to offer a somewhat comprehensive but simple
catalog and classification of the most popular Transformer models. The paper
also includes an introduction to the most important aspects and innovation in
Transformer models.
