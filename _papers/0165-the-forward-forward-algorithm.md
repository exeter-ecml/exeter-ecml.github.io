abstract: "
The aim of this paper is to introduce a new learning procedure for neural
networks and to demonstrate that it works well enough on a few small problems
to be worth further investigation. The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the
forward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with
positive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be
generated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function
which is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for
negative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the
goodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the
squared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in
time, the negative passes could be done offline, which would make the learning
much simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the
network without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.
