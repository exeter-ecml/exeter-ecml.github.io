abstract: "
In multi-criterion optimization, decision-makers (DMs) are not often interested
in the complete Pareto-optimal front. Instead, they have preferences favoring
specific parts of the front. Multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) literature
provides a plethora of approaches for introducing DM’s preference information
in an interactive manner to solve multi-criterion optimization problems.
Interactions with DMs can be aided with a user-friendly visualization method or
by using special data analysis procedures. An earlier study has indicated the
use of self-organizing maps (SOM) as a tool for analyzing Pareto-optimal
solutions. In this paper, we demonstrate how a specific MCDM method – NIMBUS –
can be executed with the interpretable SOM (iSOM) approach iteratively to
arrive at one or more preferred solutions. A visual illustration of the entire
high-dimensional search space into multiple reduced two-dimensional spaces
allows DMs to have a better understanding of the interactions of the objectives
and constraints independently, and execute the NIMBUS decision-making procedure
with a more wholistic approach. The paper demonstrates the proposed method on a
number of multi- and many-objective numerical and engineering problems. The
approach is now ready to be integrated with other popular MCDM methods.
