Welcome to the ECML reading group.

To **lead a paper discussion** or if you wish to **suggest a paper** for the 
group to read then please email
[George De Ath](mailto:g.de.ath@exeter.ac.uk) or [Tinkle Chugh](mailto:T.Chugh@exeter.ac.uk).

At each reading group the paper lead will briefly give an overview of the paper,
either verbally or with slides if they wish, and then lead a discussion of each
section of the paper. Note that if a paper is from one of the big machine 
learning conferences, e.g. NeurIPS or ICML, it is very likely that a recording
exists of the paper's author's presentation. These recordings can be used as an 
alternative to the paper lead presenting an overview of the paper.
