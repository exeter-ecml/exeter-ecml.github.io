Michael Dunne will present some of his ongoing work on **Variance-Based Sensitivity Analysis for History Matching**, which involves conducting Bayesian variance-based sensitivity analysis in regions of not-ruled-out-yet space after History Matching waves, based on the work of 
[Oakley and O'Hagan (2004)](
papers/0093-probabilistic-sensitivity-analysis-of-complex-models-a-bayesian-approach).
For those unfamiliar with History Matching, Wikipedia has a short, [but informative, description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_History_Matching).
