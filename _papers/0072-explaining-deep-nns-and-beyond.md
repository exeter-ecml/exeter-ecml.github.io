abstract: "
With the broader and highly successful usage of machine learning (ML) in
industry and the sciences, there has been a growing demand for explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI). Interpretability and explanation methods for
gaining a better understanding of the problem-solving abilities and strategies
of nonlinear ML, in particular, deep neural networks, are, therefore,
receiving increased attention. In this work, we aim to: 1) provide a timely
overview of this active emerging field, with a focus on *post hoc*
explanations, and explain its theoretical foundations; 2) put 
interpretability algorithms to a test both from a theory and comparative
evaluation perspective using extensive simulations; 3) outline best practice
aspects, i.e., how to best include interpretation methods into the standard
usage of ML; and 4) demonstrate successful usage of XAI in a representative
selection of application scenarios. Finally, we discuss challenges and
possible future directions of this exciting foundational field of ML.
