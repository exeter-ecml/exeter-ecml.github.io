abstract: "
Analyzing geometric properties of high-dimensional loss functions, such as
local curvature and the existence of other optima around a certain point in
loss space, can help provide a better understanding of the interplay between
neural network structure, implementation attributes, and learning performance.
In this work, we combine concepts from high-dimensional probability and
differential geometry to study how curvature properties in lower-dimensional
loss representations depend on those in the original loss space. We show that
saddle points in the original space are rarely correctly identified as such in
lower-dimensional representations if random projections are used. In such
projections, the expected curvature in a lower-dimensional representation is
proportional to the mean curvature in the original loss space. Hence, the mean
curvature in the original loss space determines if saddle points appear, on
average, as either minima, maxima, or almost flat regions. We use the
connection between expected curvature and mean curvature (i.e., the normalized
Hessian trace) to estimate the trace of Hessians without calculating the
Hessian or Hessian-vector products as in Hutchinson's method. Because random
projections are not able to correctly identify saddle information, we propose
to study projections along Hessian directions that are associated with the
largest and smallest principal curvatures. We connect our findings to the
ongoing debate on loss landscape flatness and generalizability. Finally, we
illustrate our method in numerical experiments on different image classifiers with up to about $$7 \\times 10^6$$ parameters.
