abstract: "
This document aims to be a self-contained, mathematically precise overview of
transformer architectures and algorithms (*not* results). It covers what
transformers are, how they are trained, what they are used for, their key
architectural components, and a preview of the most prominent models. The
reader is assumed to be familiar with basic ML terminology and simpler neural
network architectures such as MLPs.
