abstract: "
In many real-world applications, multi-objective optimization problems may have
more than one Pareto sets. The goal of multi-modal multi-objective optimization
is to find all Pareto sets in the decision space. As a relatively new research
area, difficulties in solving multi-modal multi-objective optimization problems
have not been carefully analyzed in the literature. In this paper, first we
point out that standard evolutionary multi-objective algorithms show
difficulties when solving multimodal multi-objective optimization problems.
Next, using the concept of genetic drift, we clearly explain the decrease of
diversity in the decision space during the evolutionary process. Then, we
report performance evaluation results of state-of-the-art evolutionary
multi-modal multi-objective algorithms using scalable test problems.
